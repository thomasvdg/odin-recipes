    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Moules-frites is a traditional comfort food item consisting of mussels
      paired with Belgian fries on the side. The dish is commonly found in
      Belgium, the Netherlands, and northern France. The condiment of choice
      accompanying the dish is mayonnaise, providing an additional note of
      richness.

    <p>
      Mussels are a Belgian staple - cheap and abundant, they were originally
      considered a poor man's meal, and have been paired with fried potatoes for
      a long time at the country's famous friteries (fry shops). It is believed
      that the dish is originally from Belgium, because Belgians were the first
      to pair the mussels with fries, commonly eaten throughout the country in
      wintertime, when no fish was available.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1kg fresh mussels</li>
      <li>3 large spring onions</li>
      <li>1 large shallot , peeled and halved</li>
      <li>1 carrot , peeled and halved lengthways</li>
      <li>2 fat garlic cloves , peeled</li>
      <li>1 fresh red chilli</li>
      <li>1 bunch thyme</li>
      <li>handful flat-leaf parsley</li>
      <li>100ml olive oil</li>
      <li>150ml dry white wine (ideally Muscadet)</li>
      <li>1 tsp Pernod</li>
      <li>2 tbsp crème fraîche</li>
      <li>
        2 large potatoes , about 300g each, peeled (preferably Maris Piper, King
        Edward or Weltje)
      </li>
      <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>
      <li>½ tsp cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>oil , for deep frying, (ideally light olive oil)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Tip the mussels into a large bowl of cold water. Discard any that remain
        open when tapped, then drain well and pull away any ‘beards’. (Fresh
        mussels look black and shiny and should only smell pleasantly of the
        deep sea – the vast majority should be tightly closed. Avoid any that
        smell ‘fishy’, look dry or are mostly open.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Thinly slice the vegetables and garlic. Roll the chilli in your hands to
        loosen the seeds, then slit in half and shake out the seeds. Slice the
        flesh into thin sticks, then stack together and finely chop. Pick over
        the thyme sprigs, discarding the thick stalks, and pick the parsley
        leaves from the stalks. Prepare the chips (see recipe, below right).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a large, heavy-based sauté pan (with a lid) on the hob and heat
        until you can feel a strong heat rising. Pour in the oil, then
        immediately toss in all of the vegetables, chilli and thyme. The thyme
        sprigs will crackle if the pan is hot enough. Cook for about 1½ mins,
        shaking the pan and stirring the vegetables until they start to wilt.
      </li>
      <li>
        With the heat still on high, toss in all the mussels and shake the pan
        so they form an even layer. Cover with a lid and cook for another 1-2
        mins, shaking the pan once or twice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uncover the pan and pour in the wine and Pernod. Shake and cook for
        another 1½ mins so the wine reduces by half, then cover again and cook
        for another min. Place a large colander over a bowl and tip the mussels
        and vegetables into the centre. Discard any mussels that remain closed.
        Fry the chips.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the strained liquid back in the pan, reheat and stir in the crème
        fraîche and whole parsley leaves. Check the seasoning; you may not need
        any salt. Return the mussels and vegetables to the pan and reheat,
        shaking the pan, then divide between two large soup bowls. Serve the
        chips and mayonnaise (recipe below) alongside.
