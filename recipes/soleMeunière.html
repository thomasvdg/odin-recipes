    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The dish that made Julia Child fall in love with French cuisine, sole
      meunière highlights the simple flavors of fresh fish, butter, lemon and
      parsley. Fish is the center of the dish, so using a quality fillet is
      important: A true English Dover sole is preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clarified butter, which takes a few extra minutes to prepare, can take on
      heat without browning, making it ideal for pan-frying fish. A classic sole
      meunière is made with a bone-in fillet, but boneless sole is faster and
      easier. You'll find a recipe for clarified butter here. This recipe is
      part of The New Essentials of French Cooking, a guide to definitive dishes
      every modern cook should master.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>
        6 4-ounce skinless, boneless sole or other thin fish fillets, patted dry
      </li>
      <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
      <li>Freshly ground white or black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons clarified butter</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced, at room temperature</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons minced parsley</li>
      <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oven to 200 degrees and place a large oven-safe plate or baking
        sheet inside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place flour on a large, shallow plate. Season both sides of fish fillets
        with salt and pepper to taste. Dredge fish in flour, shaking off excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a 12-inch nonstick or enamel-lined skillet over medium-high heat,
        heat 2 tablespoons clarified butter until bubbling. Place half of the
        fish fillets in the pan and cook until just done, 2 to 3 minutes per
        side, then transfer to the plate or baking sheet in the oven to keep
        warm. Add 2 more tablespoons clarified butter to skillet and heat until
        bubbling, then cook remaining fillets. Wipe out the skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange the fish on a warm serving platter. Top with parsley. In
        reserved skillet, heat remaining 4 tablespoons unsalted butter until
        bubbling and golden, 1 to 2 minutes, then pour evenly over fillets.
        Serve immediately, with lemon wedges on the side.
