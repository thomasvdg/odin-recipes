<p>The cut of meat most often chosen for making Beef Stew is chuck, which comes from meat extending from the foreleg to the shoulder of a steer. The chuck is a good piece of meat to cook slowly in moisture, breaking down the connective tissues into a tender piece of meat that is rich in flavor.</p>
