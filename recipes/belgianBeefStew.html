<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  A food dish that combines beef with a variety of other ingredients, such as
  potatoes, vegetables, herbs, spices, and broth to create a savory dish, rich
  in flavor and often served as the main dish.
</p>
<p>
  The cut of meat most often chosen for making Beef Stew is chuck, which comes
  from meat extending from the foreleg to the shoulder of a steer. The chuck is
  a good piece of meat to cook slowly in moisture, breaking down the connective
  tissues into a tender piece of meat that is rich in flavor.
